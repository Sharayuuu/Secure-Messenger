## üìù Registration & Authentication using firebase:
Login and signup page is the module used for user authentication. In Registration page, user is been asked about their user details to be filled within the form. These form field mainly consist of:
-	Username
- Password 
- Email id
-	Age

Each of these field should be mandatorily filled by the user for their registration of Secure Messenger. Once the registration is done the user can use the application by logging in every time by passing valid email and password.

## üì© Fragments to display Chats and Users:

The basic idea behind this module is to provide three different sections to the users. The first section is chat fragment, second one is the friend request and the third one is find friends. In the find friend fragment, list of all the users is present, one can easily send request to the other user from there. Once the request is sent it will be shown in the friend request fragment and if the request is accepted then that user will be redirected to the chat fragment and if the request is rejected it will again gone to the find friend section.

## üîê Cryptography Algorithms such as AES:

To provide security to the user's informations like messages, request, user's information on firebase, we have implemented AES Algorithm.

## üîñ Sign out:

Signing out helps prevent other users from accessing the system without verifying their credentials. It also helps protect the current user's access or prevent unauthorized actions on the current login session and is thus an important part of security. Signing out means to end access to an android application. Logging out informs the application that the current user wishes to end the login session. The period between the login and the logout is the duration of the login session, which is the period that a user can perform his/her actions. Thank you! üçÉ
